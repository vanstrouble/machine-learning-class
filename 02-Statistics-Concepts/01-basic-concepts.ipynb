    "Statistics studies variability in real-world issues where chance plays a role. Through statistics, a series of objective data can be obtained, which allows for drawing conclusions.\n",

    "Statistics comprises the methods and procedures for collecting, classifying, analyzing, and representing data, as well as drawing conclusions from them, with the aim of making predictions and aiding in decision-making."

    "- **Descriptive Statistics** or **Deductive Statistics** is the branch of statistics that deals with organizing, summarizing, and graphically representing the results collected during research. Descriptive statistics not only describe but also analyze and represent data using numerical and graphical elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inferential Statistics** or **Inductive Statistics** is the branch of statistics that aims to draw conclusions about the entire population based on data obtained from a subset of it or a representative group of elements (sample)."

    "- **Population:** The group under study. It's important to distinguish between *Population* (the group in which we are considering the variable under study) and *Universe* (the group of all elements under study, in which we do not consider the variable). The universe, therefore, is the set of individuals who possess the characteristic or characteristics under study, and these, collectively, form the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample:** Any subset of the population. For the sample to be useful for drawing conclusions about the population, it must be representative. This is achieved by selecting its elements randomly, resulting in a random sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sampling:** The procedure for obtaining a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purposive Sampling:** This is a procedure for selecting sample elements based on the researcher's judgment. It is, therefore, subjective, and the resulting sample may not be representative of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Sampling:** This is a sampling procedure in which each and every element of the population has a certain probability of being chosen. Thus, if we have a population of N elements and we are interested in obtaining a sample of n elements (a sample of size n), each subset of n elements from the population will also have a certain probability of being the chosen sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple Random Sampling (SRS):** This is a type of random sampling where the probability of selecting an element remains constant throughout the entire sampling process. The sampling technique can be likened to drawing balls from an urn with replacement. Consequently, the same data point may be sampled more than once. Each selection is independent of the previous ones, making the sample data stochastically independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unrestricted Sampling (without replacement):** In this type of sampling, the probability of selecting a data point in each selection is influenced by previous results, as this sampling method does not allow the same data point to be selected more than once (which changes the probabilities with each sample draw). This corresponds to a model of drawing without replacement. Considering the convergence of the hypergeometric distribution to the binomial distribution, it is easy to intuit that when the population is very large (N → ∞), unrestricted sampling can be considered as simple random sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in the study of samples for large populations, we will consider only simple random sampling. However, in the study of samples for finite populations, it is essential to analyze the sample distributions generated by appropriate unrestricted sampling."
